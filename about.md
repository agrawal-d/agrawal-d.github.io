# About me

Hi! My name is Divyanshu Agrawal. I am a programmer, and I enjoy making cool stuff with code, such as this blog! I am currently in my second year of study of computer science at [BITS Pilani (Hyderabad Campus)](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/Hyderabad/). The course I have enjoyed the most ( till now ) [CS F222 Discrete Structures for Computer Science](documents/CS_F222_A4.pdf),  I keep tinkering with various projects, most of which you cand find at my github homepage [here](https://github.com/ahrawal-d).

Apart from programming, I enjoy reading [books](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/26803636). My favourite genre is Fantasy. Some my favourite books are **To Kill a Mockingbird** by Harper Lee, **Eragon** by Christopher Paolini and **The Call of the Wild** by Jack London. I also enjoy drawing occasionally.

I like to read a lot about computer science, culture, technology, and philosophy. As a consequence, my favourite websites are [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/news) and [JSTOR Daily](https://daily.jstor.org/). I love to read detailed articles about anything at all, so if you find something interesting on the internet, please do [share it with me](/contact).

You can get in touch with me [here](/contact).
